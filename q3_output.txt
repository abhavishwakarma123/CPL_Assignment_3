The original augmented matrix is: 

[0.0 , 2.0 , 1.0 , | 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ]
[4.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , | 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ]
[-1.0 , 2.0 , 0.0 , | 0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 ]


The final augmented matrix is: 

[1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , | -0.33 , 0.33 , 0.33 ]
[0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 , | -0.16 , 0.16 , 0.66 ]
[0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 , | 1.33 , -0.33 , -1.33 ]


The inverse matrix is hence: 

[-0.33, 0.33, 0.33]
[-0.16, 0.16, 0.66]
[1.33, -0.33, -1.33]


The product of A and A inverse is 

[1.01, -0.01, -0.01]
[0.01, 0.99, -0.01]
[0.01, -0.01, 0.99]
