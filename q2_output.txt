The given equations are:


0.0 x +  2.0 y +  -3.0 z =  -1.0
1.0 x +  0.0 y +  1.0 z =  0.0
1.0 x +  -1.0 y +  0.0 z =  3.0


The original augmented matrix is: 

[0.0 , 2.0 , -3.0 | -1.0  ]
[1.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 | 0.0  ]
[1.0 , -1.0 , 0.0 | 3.0  ]


The final augmented matrix is: 

[1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 | 1.0  ]
[0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 | -2.0  ]
[0.0 , 0.0 , 1.0 | -1.0  ]


The solutions are:


x  =  1.0
y  =  -2.0
z  =  -1.0
